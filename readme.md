# Graph

This is a clone of Ivan Johansen's [Graph](<https://www.padowan.dk/>) software, a GPL 2 licensed desktop graphing application, because I keep forgetting where it lives and SVN isn't pleasant.

This branch is r2108 verbatim from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/graph/code/2108/).

For the 4.4.2 / r1367 release with installer, see the [r1367 branch](https://github.com/Spookerton/Graph/tree/r1367).

See [Graph/COPYING](Graph/COPYING) and [Graph/ReadMe.txt](Graph/ReadMe.txt) for license, credit, and instructions.
